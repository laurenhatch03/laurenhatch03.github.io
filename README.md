For this project, I used machine learning techniques to analyze the factors affecting whether an individual wants to change their career.
## Introduction 

Many people go to college, get a degree in a field they're interested in, and move on to get a job unrelated to their field of study. The question arises: does your field of study determine your career path? In this report, you will see the different variables that could lead to someone wanting to change their occupation.

Using the “Field of Study vs Occupation” dataset on Kaggle, I looked at variables that I believed would contribute to an individual, ages 20-30, wanting to change their occupation. I decided to use supervised learning because I wanted to make predictions based on data patterns between the relationships of variables. I modeled these variables with data plots to get a visual representation of the data. I made a heat correlation map to find the variables that contribute most to wanting to change their career. I then made REC curves for ridege regression, SVR, decision tree, and logistic regression to show how well different models can predict these values. I then made a confusion matrix to visually show how well these models can predict the data. I also made a logistic regression model and showed the ROC curve to go with it. I made a decision tree plot to follow and show what values within variables lead to whether an individual is likely to change theri occupation or not. Lastly, to confirm the correct variable were being used, I plotted the feature importance to clearly show which variables contribute the most to these predictions




## Data
[Click here to view the dataset I used!](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jahnavipaliwal/field-of-study-vs-occupation/data)

The dataset includes 38,444 rows, each representing a different person. I narrowed it down to ages 20-30 (10,525 rows) to see how it affects people closer to me. With 22 columns, each attribute contributes to different information about each person. These 22 columns include their field of study, current occupation, age, gender, years of experience, education level, industry growth rate, job satisfaction, work-life balance, job opportunities, salary, job security, career change interest, skills gap, family influence, mentorship available, certifications, freelancing experience, geographic mobility, professional networks, career change events, technology adoption, and likely to change occupation. The website details each one and how the numbers are inputted into the dataset file. For this project, I used likely to change occupation as my dependent variable to see what independent variables affect that likelihood, and use them for predictions.



## Preprocessing Steps
## Modelling

Here are some more details about the machine learning approach, and why this was deemed appropriate for the dataset. 

The model might involve optimizing some quantity. You can include snippets of code if it is helpful to explain things.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
X, y = make_classification(n_features=4, random_state=0)
clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
clf.fit(X, y)
clf.predict([[0, 0, 0, 0]])
```

This is how the method was developed.
